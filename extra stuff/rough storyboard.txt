Post-bombing main string: Meet and help Sal, a Syndicate fixer and contractor, who is dealing with some shady business.
	1) Run into Sal while in a spaceport and he asks you to transport something from the Deep to the Syndicate. The pay is rather large and the way he describes it seems off, so the player is able to decline without consequence. 
	2) Arrive in the Deep to have the cargo loaded. Get stopped by a DS Guard and questioned about what you're doing. Be allowed to go on your way. Speak with Sal on return. (2)
	3 + alt) Sal wants you to transport a few friends of his friends to a frontier world. Followed by a Syndicate ship.
	4) After landing with the "friends", they board another ship and make their way toward the pirate worlds. Sal wants you back on some other world.
	5) Notice someone sneaking around the spaceport when Sal shows up, late, and pulls your attention away. Look back and the stranger is gone. Sal wants you to scan the cargo of a ship that's about to leave, then land on the planet once you're done. Scan the ship and it has nuclear testing equipment. On return to Foundry to Sal's private hangar, Sal says he's trying to find out who's behind the bombings and thinks who you just scanned has something to do with it. "Get out of my hangar and meet me in the spaceport. I don't enjoy having guests here for too long." (2)
	6) Meet with Sal in the hangar and he bad mouths the FW. "It's probably them. Innocent until proven guilty and all, you know. No one has any hard proof and the Navy's too afraid to pull the trigger and find it." Sal asks you to bring him to a nearby pirate world so that he can speak with his "contacts".
	7) Sal brings you to a island complex on Deadman's Cove because he wants you to stick near him and make sure you're fine. Bump into a pirate, he pulls a knife and looks at you, he looks at Sal and puts the knife away, then says "Be careful who you associate with, punk." Sal speaks with contact who says how everyone's loving the situation because of how the Navy are disoriented. "This'll be great for business." "I'm sure it will be for scum like you." They both laugh. "Now get off my island!" the warlord says as he motions to his men to remove you, still laughing along with Sal. On return in a private hangar of Sal's, he speak with the CEO. (2)
	8) The CEO suggests speaking with more warlords. Sal explains to the player how most pirates may be anarchists and not give two shits about what the Syndicate wants, but Sal is the Syndicate's main contact to the major pirate warlords. He makes a joke about the last guy he had to bring him places looking at a warlord wrong and being shot, then laughs it off and suggest you go to Stormhold to have a chat with another warlord.
	9) Chat with a warlord on Stormhold. This warlord gives the same report as the last one, saying they aren't entirely sure what's up but business is good because of it. Suggests checking Covert and Bucanneer Bay, but Sal mentions how the last time he spoke with the warlords down there they said they'd kill him if he ever showed back up. Player does something that they shouldn't, and as you leave Sal looks you dead in the eyes and says he wasn't joking about the person before you that died. Land back on a Syndicate world where Sal says he needs to do some work in the Paradise Worlds. (2)
	10) Land on Glory. Meet some plastic surgeried moneybags pissed about the Navy spreading out more.
	11) Land on Prime to meet a "business associate" in private.
	12) Land on Pearl. Sal gets word of needing to pick something up on Geminus, but first wants to go to Hestia to meet an "old friend".
	13) Land on Hestia. Sal makes a joke about thinking of retiring there
	14) Pick something up from Geminus; Sal refuses to leave the ship and tells you where to find the pickup point, which is a box marked radioactive. Return it to a Syndicate world.
	15) Sal wants you to bring him back to Stormhold to have a chat with the warlord again.
	16) Sal is pulled off of your ship as soon as the doors open. "Not like this. Think of all the good I've done you boys." The pirates tell you to get back and leave. Try and save Sal and you die. Leave and as you try to get out of there quick, you hear a number of shots go off. Sal "dies" off screen. Launch.
