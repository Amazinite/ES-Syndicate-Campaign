# 36 tons of cargo space becomes 8 tons of outfit space and 24 tons of space devoted to making sure that cooling outfits still work as intended. The downside of the Outfits Expansion is how it hurts cooling. The downside of the Precision Expansion will be how it hurts turning and acceleration given how much more massive it is.
# 1 outfit : 4 cargo space conversion compared to the Outfits Expansion's 3 outfit : 4 cargo space conversion.

	description "An outfits expansion system which converts cargo space into outfit space in a more precise manor, allowing for cooling systems to work properly at the cost of converting less space." # Description not finalized

# Precision expansions require specific knowledge of the design of the ship itself. This means that at first they will only appear on a select few Syndicate ships where the design with precision expansions has been perfected, and only later on will they become available to the player to install on all ships. Yes, lore pretty much ends up going out the window with this outfit as soon as you talk about bringing alien ships to human space in order to install these things.

# In case anyone's wondering if this will become OP, don't worry.
# One can install 4 outfits expansions (~83.7% normal cooling efficiency) before the cooling inefficiency starts to get too bad. That's 80 cargo space for 60 outfits space. To get the same 60 outfit space from precision expansion requires 7.5 expansions. Rounding up to 8, that's 288 cargo space needed to fit those 8 precision expansions. 
# If you want to push it and go to 7 outfits expansions (53.4% cooling) then you need 14 (rounded up from 13.125) precision expansions, or 504 cargo to beat it (meaning that 14 is the most precision expansions you can put on a Bactrian, gaining 112 extra outfit space at the cost of 504 cargo space and 336 extra mass, instead of the 7 outfits expansions which only sacrifice 140 cargo space, 35 extra mass, and 46.6% of your cooling).

# The Bactrian with max mass expansions had 1,130 outfit space. This was more than ANY OTHER SHIP IN THE GAME (the hate still flows). The Bactrian with max precision expansions gets to only 852 outfit space. This matches the Solifuge with max precision expansions and is beat by the Kar Ik Vot 349 (highest outfit space under precision expansions), Model 512, Hurricane, Heliarch Punisher, and Model 256 (above the Bactrian by 21). The Prospector, given its low base outfit space, only reaches 806 outfit space with max precision expansions, and that's at the cost of a whopping 648 additional mass, doubling the Prospector's base mass then adding 8 to a grand total of 1288 tons, not including the additional 806 tons that can come from outfits. 
# Have fun.

# Excerpts from a discussion regarding what unique outfits should be unlocked through the Syndicate campaign
# "To my understanding, the Wolf Pack have only recently aquired nukes. The Syndicate on the other hand have been planning things out for a while and have had much more time than the Wolf Pack. There's also the fact that the Syndicate have better infrastructure than the Wolf Pack, so it wouldn't be surprising to me that the Syndicate would have some sort of loading system for their nukes and the Wolf Pack wouldn't.
# Taken from FW Checkmate: `He laughs. "I'm afraid that's not possible. Unlike most missile systems, we haven't yet developed any sort of feed system that would let you fire multiple missiles from the same gun port. So, it's a weapon you can only fire once from a given port."`

# So, who's going to have fun with this monstrocity?
#	Too massive to fit on anything smaller than a light warship, and even then a few smaller light warships can't equip it
# 	Fires once every 10 seconds (a bunch of singular missiles would fire faster)
#	Takes 40 seconds of non-stop firing to empty its hopper
#	Yields a maximum of 45,000 shield damage and 35,000 hull damage
#	This is beat out by the Punisher Torpedo's total yield of 60,000 shield damage and 76,000 hull damage, but it takes longer (52 seconds) for the Punisher Torpedo to fire all its ammo
#	7.6 million credits to buy and fill with ammo vs the Punisher Torpedo's 2.65 mil

# Do you think it's worth passing up over a cloaking device? Probably not, but I'd say its pretty damn close compared to the FW Checkmate-Reconciliation reward different. Like seriously, who wants some afterburner, some shield generators that become obsolete as soon as you meet more aliens, and a crappy nuclear missile that you can only load one of in each gun port when you can have a device that can't be beat at any tier (yet)? This warhead loading system on the other hand is useful as long as you have the money and as long as we can't buy Finisher Launchers, as the Finisher Torpedo is the only secondary weapon that beats out the warhead loading system in terms of damage yield. (By comparison, the Nuclear Missile obtained through the Checkmate branch is technically beat by all but the Javelin, Meteor, and Sidewinder missile launchers.)
# Going to be honest, I would totally take this over a cloaking device just so I could use a bunch of them on a Kar Ik Vot. Load up 5 on a Shield Beetle and say goodbye to whatever you're staring at, because it's about to eat 4,500 shield damage and 3,500 hull damage of pure pain per second multiplied by however Shield Beetle you have (along with an instantaneous 45,000 shield and 35,000 hull damage right from the start from the first launched nukes. Three Shield Beetles with 5 loading systems each and that Kar Ik Vot is going to be instantly disabled, and unlike the normal Nuclear Missile you still have 4 more left over for whoever else enters the system.)

# We all love our cannon weapons. The Plasma Cannon, Particle Cannon, and Proton Gun. The Plasma Cannon gets its own little upgrade in the FW story, gaining a dual turret version. Maybe the Syndicate's cannon, the Proton Gun, should get its own little upgrade. Now a Proton Turret would just be too easy a thing to do and pretty much be a cop-out, so how about something different?

# The magnificant Modified Proton Gun seeks to compete with the Particle Cannon of the Navy; it fires further (even if only by 4 range), travels almost as fast (26 vs 30 velocity) and deals 37.7% more damage thanks to being able to fire 33.3% faster than its predecessor. Although it doesn't have the accuracy of the Particle Cannon and it requires more energy and produces (way) more heat, you should still totally buy it, because as we all know, the Proton Gun is the best cannon there is!
