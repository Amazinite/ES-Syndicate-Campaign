When Nate sees you looking down at your clothing, he says "Don't worry, the fancy people always come first, but they're only a small part of the party." A few minutes later, another ship lands which unloads about a dozen passengers all wearing more civilian style clothing, some of which even manages to make you look like the fancy one.`

You spend your time wandering around the crowd, dancing, and socializing with people willing to talk to you. Never before have you seen a party this big, and you feel slightly bad for whoever is going to clean up the mess that gets left behind.`
