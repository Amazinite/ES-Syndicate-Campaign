	description "The Prospector is a recent development from Syndicated Shipyards, and is the only ship in human space specifically designed for mining operations. With more cargo space than even a Bulk Freighter and enough weaponry to instantly shred asteroids, the Prospector is indomitable in it's role as a mining freighter. Due to its staggering cargo capacity, the Prospector is also highly versatile, and can be retrofitted as a capable transport or warship."
